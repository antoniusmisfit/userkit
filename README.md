# UserKit
## A rudimentary user account manager for FreeDOS
### Installation
Just place userkit.bat anywhere in your DOS environment's PATH.
You can add "userkit login" to the end of C:\FDAUTO.BAT to login upon bootup, but you must create at least one regular user before doing this.
Note: UserKit currently only works with FreeDOS.
### Usage
Create a new user:
userkit adduser [username]

Remove a user:
userkit rmuser [username]

Login as a user:
userkit login

List regular users:
userkit users

#### TODO
* Add an "admin" command to approximate "system administrator" mode.
* User password management.
* User access control.
* MS-DOS and DR-DOS compatibility support.
